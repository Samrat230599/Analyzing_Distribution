# Analyzing_Distribution
It is Week 2 Assignment of Data Lit , a course on Data Science by theschool.ai ,led by Siraj Raval.

The assignment was to first, tell which airline would help one to get to their destination with minimum delay, by using Probability Distribution curve.And secondly, verify central-limit-theorem (visually, by plotting) using the same dataset.

It became evident that with larger sample size the spread of the distribution decreases.
